    "Abstract": "Document AI, or Document Intelligence, is a relatively new research topic that refers to the techniques for automatically reading, understanding, and analyzing business documents. It is an important research direction for natural language processing and computer vision. In recent years, the popularity of deep learning technology has greatly advanced the development of Document AI, such as document layout analysis, visual information extraction, document visual question answering, document image classification, etc. This paper briefly reviews some of the representative models, tasks, and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we also introduce early-stage heuristic rule-based document analysis, statistical machine learning algorithms, and deep learning approaches especially pre-training methods. Finally, we look into future directions for Document AI research.",
    "Key Findings": "Automated information processing is the foundation and prerequisite for digital transformation. Nowadays, there are increasingly higher requirements for processing power, processing speed, and processing accuracy. Taking the business field as an example, electronic business documents cover a large amount of complicated information such as purchase receipts, industry reports, business emails, sales contracts, employment agreements, commercial invoices, and personal resumes. The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) industry has been created in this background, using AI technology to help a large number of people free from complicated electronic document processing tasks, meanwhile improving productivity through a series of supporting automation tools. One of the key cores of RPA is the Document AI technique. In the past 30 years, document analysis has mainly gone through three stages, from the early-stage heuristic rules, to the statistical machine learning, and recently deep learning methods, which greatly advances analysis performance and accuracy. At the same time, we have also observed that the large-scale self-supervised general document-level pre-trained model represented by LayoutLM has also received more and more attention and usage, and has gradually become the basic unit for building more complex algorithms. There are also quite a few follow-up research work that emerged recently, which accelerates development of the Document AI.",
